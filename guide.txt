Given below strategy will likely give you an estimate of priority ... DYOR!

                  Step 1 : Assign Points to Branches from 1 to 10.
                           ( 10 for highest preference and 1 for lowest )

                  Step 2 : Assign points to College from 1 to 10 as follow :

                              Score1 : Brand Value ( Points 1 to 4 )

                                           --> Old IIT  = 4
                                           --> New IIT  = 2
                                           --> Rest IIT = 3

                                           --> Old NIT     = 3
                                           --> NE New NIT  = 1
                                           --> Rest NIT    = 2

                                           --> IIIT Hyderabad  = 4
                                           --> Old IIIT        = 3
                                           --> Rest IIIT       = 2

                              Score2 : Proximity ( Points 0 or 1 )

                                           --> Near HOME      = 1
                                           --> Doesn't matter = 1
                                           --> Else           = 0

                              Score3 : Industrial Exposure ( Points 1 to 3 )

                                           --> Location ( Metropolition/Industrial Hub )  = 3
                                           --> Location ( Medicore City )                 = 2
                                           --> Remote Location                            = 1

                              Score4 : Student-Rank Variance ( Points  0 to 2 )

                                           --> Positive Variance  = 2
                                           --> Neutral Variance   = 1
                                           --> Negative Variance  = 0

                              TOTAL = Score1 + Score2 + Score3 + Score4
                              
                  Step 3 : Product of Total From Step1 and Step2.
                           Choice with higher score may be more preferable!

                  NOTE : Maximum Score = 100
                         Minimum Score = 2
