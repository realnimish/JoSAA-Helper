I developed this app last year(2018) to help me filter colleges based upon various factors and it helped me a lot. So I'm open-sourcing the code to help
others. The data(Source : JoSAA) used in the program accounts ONLY for General AIR and NO Home-State quota is considered. As of now the program requires
to the point input for correct response. I will commit the changes to make it more user-friendly in the upcoming future. Till then if you face any problem
kindly let me know.
