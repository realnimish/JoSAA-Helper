I developed this app last year (2018) to help me filter colleges based upon various factors and it helped me a lot. So I'm open sourcing the code to help others. The Data(Source : JoSSA) used in the app accounts ONLY for General AIR and NO Home-State Quota is considered. As of now the app requires to the point input for correct response. I will commit the changes to make it more user-friendly in the upcoming future. Till then if you face any problem using the app kindly let me know.
